The planets
Consider the planet earth revolving around the sun in elliptical orbit having two focii. All the planets move in the same shape around the sun.
Any object which is thrown towards any massive object can either turn into a circle, a ellipse or a parabola. If the initial velocity of the object is 0, 
then it will be circular, if its more than a 0 it will be elliptical and else it will be parabolic(if the velcity is very higher than v). Given a series of n objects(and 
their speeds) thrown towards a planet find the no. of objects whihc will follow circular, elliptical or parabolic path.

INPUT
firstly input the no. of test cases t
in every tes case take v and n
take an array of n number representing velocity

OUTPUT
print three number: No. of planets with circular, elliptical and parabolic pathway
