6 3
1 5 3 4 2 6

Expected Output : 5
Code Output : 4

The given test case gives wrong output on provided code.

Reason: 
The code does not cover all possible coverage of range removal. In given code we can remove the subarray [3,4,2] which leads to final array to be [1,5,6] whose median is 5 largest possible, while the given solution does not considers this case, it checks for final array [1,5,3] and [4,2,6] only.
